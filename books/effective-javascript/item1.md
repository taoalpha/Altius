- resources:
	- [wiki: ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript)
    - [ECMA 262, 8th edition](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf)

- MVI(most valuable item):
	- always test strict code in envs that perform the strict-mode checks
    - beware of concatenating scripts that differ in their expectations about strict mode
